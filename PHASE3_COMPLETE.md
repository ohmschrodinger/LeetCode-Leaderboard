## 🎯 How It Works

6. User can sort by clicking sort buttons (URL updates)
7. User can refresh to get latest data

### **Ranking Calculation:**
```
Users sorted by selected metric (desc)
↓
Ties handled by weekly_points, then total_solved, then username
↓
Ranks assigned (same score = same rank)

Displayed in table with badges
```
